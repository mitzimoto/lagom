## About Eric Mitz
---
Hi. I'm [Eric Mitz](/). I'm a senior software engineer at [EMC<sup>2</sup>](emc.com) where I work on the software upgrade feature of the [VNXe](http://www.emc.com/storage/vnx/vnxe-series.htm). I also founded [The Clunker Junker](http://theclunkerjunker.com); a company who helps people get rid of their junk cars by connecting them to companies who want to buy them. 

In July 2012 my wife and I [risked it all](/why-i-risked-everything-and-moved-to-florida) and moved from Massachusetts to a little town called Parrish, tucked between Tampa and Sarasota, Florida. I have been happily working remotely for EMC ever since.

I also love auto racing, techno-gadgets, and building things in Ruby on Rails.
