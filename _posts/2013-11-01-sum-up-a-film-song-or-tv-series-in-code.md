I found this [awesome thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1poo0n/programmers_of_reddit_how_would_you_sum_up_a/) in [/r/AskReddit](http://reddit.com/r/askreddit) today. [/u/dingobiscuits](http://www.reddit.com/user/dingobiscuits) asks the programmers of Reddit to sum up a popular film, song, or TV series in a few lines of fake code. The answers do not disappoint.  Here are some of my favorites.

From [/u/takagi](http://www.reddit.com/user/Takagi): (Call me maybe)

```c
if (justMetYou)
{
    crazy = true;
    cout<<number<<endl;
    int x = rand()%100;
    if (x>=50)
    {
        callMe();
    }
}
```

From [/u/ZekeD](http://www.reddit.com/user/ZekeD): Batman or Hey Jude?


```perl
for ($i = 0; $i < 11; $i++){
    $chorus .= "Na ";
}

if ($subject == "Batman"){
    $chorus .= " BATMAN.";
}
else {
    $chorus .= " Hey Jude.";
}
```

From [/u/Gazz1016](http://www.reddit.com/user/Gazz1016): The Matrix

```c
int[][];
```

From [/u/Sahasrahla](http://www.reddit.com/user/Sahasrahla): Inception

```javascript
function inception(){
    return inception();
}
```

There are a bunch more very good ones in there. They made my day!
